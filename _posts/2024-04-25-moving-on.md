Time stands still  
Time moves on  
We move on  
Why

You could be with him  
At his last moments  
Many moments and years before

Old friends  
Getting older  
Staying the same

Transition time  
Quiet time  
Time for reflection

Kiss me before you go  
Lighthearted music  
Mentioning darkest times

How are we going to move on  
How can we move on  
Is it a loss  
Or a blessing that we have had you

Moving on  
Is that what life is about  
Do we have to move on

I have moved on  
It hurts to move on  
There are many ways of moving on

Love doesn't move on  
Love stays  
Love wins
